##GET START PROJECT WITH CYPRESS
prerequisite to installation

## Cypress testing tools support developers all around the world by making it easier to build and test applications. Cypress is executed in the same run loop as your application. Behind Cypress is a Node server process. Cypress and the Node process constantly communicate, synchronize, and perform tasks on behalf of each other. Because this you need to have node-js installed. After that...

To start this project you must clone the repository code and to ensure that you have all the libraries it is suggested that you do 2 steps before.

```
$ npm init --yes
```
If you have any doubts, you can consult a complete documentation on the website https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress. After that...

```
$ npm install cypress
```
with this command, cypress will be installed, bringing all its basic libraries... After that...

```
$ npx cypress open
```
-- this command will create the basic folder structure and present possible configurations such as which browser will be tested. Currently cypress covers 4 browsers. Google Chrome, Edge, Electron and Firefox
